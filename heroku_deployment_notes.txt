For the Procfile, the root directory is FIRE_EMBLEM_APP while the django project is in backend/.
Procfile must be in the root directory, therefore it should be setup as so:

web: gunicorn --pythonpath backend feh.wsgi --log-file - 
release: python backend/manage.py makemigrations --no-input


Where pythonpath specifies the django directory, and the feh.wsgi is the folder to get to wsgi.py
Release is just the path to the manage.py file.

Beyond that, you need to pip install the modules:

whitenoise
django-heroku


I believe django-heroku also downloads a few packages for you, but refer to these videos for all
of what to install and where to declare them in the files (settings, and wsgi).

More importantly, make sure __init__.py is in each of your folders. It tells Python to treat
the directory as a package and makes it easier to find the files (I think, I dunno).

If using django_heroku module, at the bottom of settings, make sure to include the staticfiles flag
as it would conflict with whitenoise. 

django_heroku.settings(locals(), staticfiles=False)

also this in the settings file is commented out

#STATICFILES_STORAGE

This is because it conflicts with whitenoise.

FOR THE DATABASE in settings:

import dj_database_url

DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.config()}

Note, I added '0.0.0.0' to the ALLOWED_HOSTS and CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS for the command
heroku local, to test if the project would run (so those aren't necessary for the project to run). I just got connection errors trying to connect to
('0.0.0.0',5000) which isn't as helpful as checking the logs on heroku's release logs which give 
more information on what's wrong. Even then, when it deployed to heroku, heroku local still didn't 
connect properly.

Some stackoverflow links to reminisce over in the future.
